# Set-TomatoNAT
Function to enable or disable NAT rules on FreshTomato routers

I am automating SSL certificate rewnwal using acme-dns but didn't want to leave my DNS server open to the web when it didn't need to, so I created this dirty little script to enable or disables my DNS NAT rule on my FreshTomato router.
